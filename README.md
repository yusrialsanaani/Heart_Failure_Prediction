# Heart_Failure_Prediction

## Machine Learnin models used in this project:
 - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
 - SVM
 - DT
 - XGboost classifiers
 - Ensemble Method: Use a majority voting approach to predict class label using KNN (k=5), SVM (kernel = rbf), DT (with optimal tree), and XGboost classifiers based on a soft voting (i.e., weighted average)
 - Artificial Neural network

# Models Comparison and Evaluation
- EHV: Ensemble Hard Voting
- ESV: Ensemble Soft Voting
- ANN: Artificial Neural network
